The parasite life cycle involves hematophagous reduviid bugs as vectors. Once parasites enter the host body, they invade diverse host cells including cardiomyocytes. Establishment of infection depends on various parasite molecules such as cruzipain, oligopeptidase B, and trans-sialidase that activate Ca2+ signaling. Internalized parasites escape from the parasitophorous vacuole using secreted pore-forming TcTOX molecule and replicate in the cytosol. Multiplied parasites eventually lyse infected host cells and are released in the circulation. During these events, the parasites manipulate host innate immunity and elicit cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. T lymphocyte responses are also disturbed.	Human Diseases; Infectious disease: parasitic	Chagas disease

The majority of urothelial carcinoma are bladder carcinomas, and urothelial carcinomas of the renal pelvis and ureter account for only approximately 7% of the total. Urothelial tumours arise and evolve through divergent phenotypic pathways. Some tumours progress from urothelial hyperplasia to low-grade non-invasive superficial papillary tumours. More aggressive variants arise either from flat, high-grade carcinoma in situ (CIS) and progress to invasive tumours, or they arise de novo as invasive tumours. Low-grade papillary tumors frequently show a constitutive activation of the receptor tyrosine kinase-Ras pathway, exhibiting activating mutations in the HRAS and fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) genes. In contrast, CIS and invasive tumors frequently show alterations in the TP53 and RB genes and pathways. Invasion and metastases are promoted by several factors that alter the tumour microenvironment, including the aberrant expression of E-cadherins (E-cad), matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), angiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).

The parasites are able to pass through the blood-brain barrier and cause neurological damage by inducing cytokines like TNF alpha, IFN gamma, and IL1. These cytokines and other metabolites such as nitric oxide and somnogenic prostaglandin D2 disturb circadian rhythms in patients with African trypanosomiasis.

In chemotaxis, events at the receptors control autophosphorylation of the CheA histidine kinase, and the phosphohistidine is the substrate for the response regulator CheY, which catalyzes the transfer of the phosphoryl group to a conserved aspartate. The resulting CheY-P can interact with the switch mechanism in the motor. This interaction causes a change in behavior, such as in direction or speed of rotation of flagella.

Specific interactions between cells and the ECM are mediated by transmembrane molecules, mainly integrins and perhaps also proteoglycans, CD36, or other cell-surface-associated components. These interactions lead to a direct or indirect control of cellular activities such as adhesion, migration, differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis. In addition, integrins function as mechanoreceptors and provide a force-transmitting physical link between the ECM and the cytoskeleton. Integrins are a family of glycosylated, heterodimeric transmembrane adhesion receptors that consist of noncovalently bound alpha- and beta-subunits.

There are four main groups: the integrin family, the immunoglobulin superfamily, selectins, and cadherins. Membrane proteins that mediate immune cell&#8211;cell interactions fall into different categories, namely those involved in antigen recognition, costimulation and cellular adhesion. Furthermore cell-cell adhesions are important for brain morphology and highly coordinated brain functions such as memory and learning. During early development of the nervous system, neurons elongate their axons towards their targets and establish and maintain synapses through formation of cell-cell adhesions. Cell-cell adhesions also underpin axon-axon contacts and link neurons with supporting schwann cells and oligodendrocytes.

At the cell-extracellular matrix contact points, specialized structures are formed and termed focal adhesions, where bundles of actin filaments are anchored to transmembrane receptors of the integrin family through a multi-molecular complex of junctional plaque proteins. Some of the constituents of focal adhesions participate in the structural link between membrane receptors and the actin cytoskeleton, while others are signalling molecules, including different protein kinases and phosphatases, their substrates, and various adapter proteins. Integrin signaling is dependent upon the non-receptor tyrosine kinase activities of the FAK and src proteins as well as the adaptor protein functions of FAK, src and Shc to initiate downstream signaling events. These signalling events culminate in reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton; a prerequisite for changes in cell shape and motility, and gene expression. Similar morphological alterations and modulation of gene expression are initiated by the binding of growth factors to their respective receptors, emphasizing the considerable crosstalk between adhesion- and growth factor-mediated signalling.

At meiosis I, one pair of sister chromatids recombines with, then segregates from, its homologous pair, while the sister chromatids segregate from each other at meoisis II. In yeast, the switch to enter growth phase or meiosis phase is controlled by nutritional signals. At the onset of meiosis, nutritional signaling pathways converge on transcriptional regulation of Ime1. Ime1 is a transcriptional activator to promote expression of early meiosis-specific genes required for pre-meiotic DNA replication and meiotic recombination. Two of the early meiosis-specific genes, a transcriptional activator, Ndt80, and a CDK2 homolog, Ime2, are required for the transcription of middle meiosis-specific genes, which includes B-type cyclin genes and genes involved in spore wall formation. Polo-like kinase Cdc5, whose expression is activated by Ndt80, is required for the critical step in meiotic progression. Cdc5 regulates sister-kinetochore co-orientation by promoting the localization of Mam1 and Lrs4, components of the co-orientation complex, to kinetochores. Cdc5 also phosphorylates the meiotic cohesin subunit Rec8, which is essential for its cleavage and removal by separase. Moreover, Cdc5 promotes the release of protein phosphatase Cdc14 from the nuclezus, which is required for anaphase I spindle disassembly and exit from meiosis I. The centromeric protein Sgo1 is a key regulator of meiotic chromosome segregation. Sgo1 with PP2A may protect pericentromeric but not arm cohesion of sister chromatids during meiosis I. Sgo1 then disappears at meiosis II to allow sister chromatids to separate.	Cellular Processes; Cell growth and death	Meiosis - yeast

Transmembrane proteins entering through clathrin-dependent endocytosis (CDE) have sequences in their cytoplasmic domains that bind to the APs (adaptor-related protein complexes) and enable their rapid removal from the PM. In addition to APs and clathrin, there are numerous accessory proteins including dynamin. Depending on the various proteins that enter the endosome membrane, these cargoes are sorted to distinct destinations. Some cargoes, such as nutrient receptors, are recycled back to the PM. Ubiquitylated membrane proteins, such as activated growth-factor receptors, are sorted into intraluminal vesicles and eventually end up in the lysosome lumen via multivesicular endosomes (MVEs). There are distinct mechanisms of clathrin-independent endocytosis (CIE) depending upon the cargo and the cell type.	Cellular Processes; Transport and catabolism	Endocytosis
