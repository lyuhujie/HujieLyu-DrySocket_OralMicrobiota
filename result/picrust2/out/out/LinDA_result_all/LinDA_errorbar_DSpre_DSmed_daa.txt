Hundreds of GPI-anchored proteins have been identified in many eukaryotes ranging from protozoa and fungi to mammals. All protein-linked GPI anchors share a common core structure, characterized by the substructure Man (a1-4) GlcN (a1-6) myo-inositol-1P-lipid. Biosynthesis of GPI anchors proceeds in three stages: (i) preassembly of a GPI precursor in the ER membrane, (ii) attachment of the GPI to the C-terminus of a newly synthesized protein in the lumen of the ER, and (iii) lipid remodeling and/or carbohydrate side-chain modifications in the ER and the Golgi. Defects of GPI anchor biosynthesis gene result in a genetic disorder, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria.

Tetracyclines contain a linear tetracyclic skeleton, which is formed from a malonamate starter unit and malonyl-CoA extender units through a common polyketide pathway [MD:M00778]. This diagram shows biosynthesis of naturally occurring tetracyclines (tetracycline, oxytetracycline and chlortetracycline) via a common intermediate anhydrotetracycline [MD:M00780 M00823].

In the tubular lumen, filtered HCO3(-) combines with H(+) in a reaction catalyzed by CA IV. The CO2 thus produced rapidly diffuses into the tubular cells and is combined with water to produce intracellular H(+) and HCO3(-), catalyzed by soluble cytoplasmic CA II. HCO3(-) is then cotransported with Na(+) into blood via the NBC-1. The intracellular H(+) produced by CA II is secreted into the tubular lumen predominantly via the NHE-3. The PT creates the "new HCO3(-)" by taking glutamine and metabolizing it to two molecules each of NH4(+) and HCO3(-). The NH4(+) is excreted into the tubular lumen, and the HCO3(-) , which is "new HCO3(-) ," is returned to the blood, where it replaces the HCO3(-) lost earlier in the titration of nonvolatile acids.

However, POPs can be degraded by certain microorganisms with acquisition of a novel set of enzymes, such as biphenyl degradation by Paraburkholderia xenovorans LB400 involving four novel enzymes encoded in operon-like structures [MD:M00543]. DDT, another POP, and carbazol are also known to be degraded in similar pathways.	Metabolism; Xenobiotics biodegradation and metabolism	Dioxin degradation
