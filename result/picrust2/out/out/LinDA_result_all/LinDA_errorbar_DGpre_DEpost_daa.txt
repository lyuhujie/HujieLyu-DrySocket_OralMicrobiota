ko04111	LinDA	DEpost	DGpre	0.0401259061280897	none	0.0401259061280897	Cell cycle - yeast	Mitotic cell cycle progression is accomplished through a reproducible sequence of events, DNA replication (S phase) and mitosis (M phase) separated temporally by gaps (G1 and G2 phases). G1, S, and G2 phases are collectively known as interphase. In yeast Cdc28 is the catalytic subunit of the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK). At G1 phase Cdc28 associates with G1-cyclins Cln1 to Cln3, while B-type cyclins Clb1 to Clb6 regulate Cdc28 during S, G2, and M phases. Cln3/Cdc28 activity is required for cells to pass through 'start', the commitment point in G1. When Cln3/Cdc28 accumulates more than a certain threshold, SBF (Swi4/Swi6) and MBF (Mbp1/Swi6) are activated, promoting transcription of Cln1, Cln2, and other genes required for S-phase progression. Cln1 and Cln2 interacting with Cdc28 promote activation of B-type cyclin associated CDK, which drives DNA replication and entry into mitosis. Specifically, Cdc28 association with Clb2 and Clb1 promotes entry into mitosis. Cells suffering from DNA damage, spindle misorientation, or spindle assembly defect do not undergo the metaphase-anaphase transition for chromosome segregation and fail to exit from mitosis. The spindle assembly checkpoint activates Mad2, which in turn prevents chromosome segregation by inhibiting degradation of the securin Pds1. Moreover, Pds1 is phosphorylated and stabilized in response to DNA damage in a Chk1-dependent manner. The spindle checkpoint is also involved in the Cdc14 release from the nucleolus. Cdc14 dephosphorylates Swi5, Sic1, and Cdh1, leading to inhibition of Cdc28 and degradation of cyclin required for mitotic exit.	Cellular Processes; Cell growth and death	Cell cycle - yeast

Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) are key regulatory enzymes, each consisting of a catalytic CDK subunit and an activating cyclin subunit. CDKs regulate the cell's progression through the phases of the cell cycle by modulating the activity of key substrates. Downstream targets of CDKs include transcription factor E2F and its regulator Rb. Precise activation and inactivation of CDKs at specific points in the cell cycle are required for orderly cell division. Cyclin-CDK inhibitors (CKIs), such as p16Ink4a, p15Ink4b, p27Kip1, and p21Cip1, are involved in the negative regulation of CDK activities, thus providing a pathway through which the cell cycle is negatively regulated.

The parasite life cycle involves hematophagous reduviid bugs as vectors. Once parasites enter the host body, they invade diverse host cells including cardiomyocytes. Establishment of infection depends on various parasite molecules such as cruzipain, oligopeptidase B, and trans-sialidase that activate Ca2+ signaling. Internalized parasites escape from the parasitophorous vacuole using secreted pore-forming TcTOX molecule and replicate in the cytosol. Multiplied parasites eventually lyse infected host cells and are released in the circulation. During these events, the parasites manipulate host innate immunity and elicit cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. T lymphocyte responses are also disturbed.	Human Diseases; Infectious disease: parasitic	Chagas disease

The parasites are able to pass through the blood-brain barrier and cause neurological damage by inducing cytokines like TNF alpha, IFN gamma, and IL1. These cytokines and other metabolites such as nitric oxide and somnogenic prostaglandin D2 disturb circadian rhythms in patients with African trypanosomiasis.

Entry of Ca2+ is driven by the presence of a large electrochemical gradient across the plasma membrane. Cells use this external source of signal Ca2+ by activating various entry channels with widely different properties. The voltage-operated channels (VOCs) are found in excitable cells and generate the rapid Ca2+ fluxes that control fast cellular processes. There are many other Ca2+-entry channels, such as the receptor-operated channels (ROCs), for example the NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptors (NMDARs) that respond to glutamate. There also are second-messenger-operated channels (SMOCs) and store-operated channels (SOCs).	Environmental Information Processing; Signal transduction	Calcium signaling pathway

The primary bile acids, cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid, are synthesized in the liver and conjugated with taurine or glycine before secretion via bile into the intestine. The conversion from cholesterol to cholic and chenodeoxycholic acids involves four steps: 1) the initiation of synthesis by 7alpha-hydroxylation of sterol precursors, 2) further modifications to the ring structures, 3) side-chain oxidation and shortening (cleavage) by three carbons, and 4) conjugation of the bile acid with taurine or glycine.

The exocrine pancreas consists of two parts, the acinar and duct cells. The primary functions of pancreatic acinar cells are to synthesize and secrete digestive enzymes. Stimulation of the cell by secretagogues such as acetylcholine (ACh) and cholecystokinin (CCK) causes the generation of an intracellular Ca2+ signal. This signal, in turn, triggers the fusion of the zymogen granules with the apical plasma membrane, leading to the polarised secretion of the enzymes. The major task of pancreatic duct cells is the secretion of fluid and bicarbonate ions (HCO3-), which neutralize the acidity of gastric contents that enter the duodenum. An increase in intracellular cAMP by secretin is one of the major signals of pancreatic HCO3- secretion. Activation of the CFTR Cl- channel and the CFTR-dependent Cl-/HCO3- exchange activities is responsible for cAMP-induced HCO3- secretion.	Organismal Systems; Digestive system	Pancreatic secretion

ko04113	LinDA	DEpost	DGpre	0.0375657542291689	none	0.0375657542291689	Meiosis - yeast	During meiosis, a single round of DNA replication is followed by two rounds of chromosome segregation, called meiosis I and meiosis II. At meiosis I, one pair of sister chromatids recombines with, then segregates from, its homologous pair, while the sister chromatids segregate from each other at meoisis II. In yeast, the switch to enter growth phase or meiosis phase is controlled by nutritional signals. At the onset of meiosis, nutritional signaling pathways converge on transcriptional regulation of Ime1. Ime1 is a transcriptional activator to promote expression of early meiosis-specific genes required for pre-meiotic DNA replication and meiotic recombination. Two of the early meiosis-specific genes, a transcriptional activator, Ndt80, and a CDK2 homolog, Ime2, are required for the transcription of middle meiosis-specific genes, which includes B-type cyclin genes and genes involved in spore wall formation. Polo-like kinase Cdc5, whose expression is activated by Ndt80, is required for the critical step in meiotic progression. Cdc5 regulates sister-kinetochore co-orientation by promoting the localization of Mam1 and Lrs4, components of the co-orientation complex, to kinetochores. Cdc5 also phosphorylates the meiotic cohesin subunit Rec8, which is essential for its cleavage and removal by separase. Moreover, Cdc5 promotes the release of protein phosphatase Cdc14 from the nuclezus, which is required for anaphase I spindle disassembly and exit from meiosis I. The centromeric protein Sgo1 is a key regulator of meiotic chromosome segregation. Sgo1 with PP2A may protect pericentromeric but not arm cohesion of sister chromatids during meiosis I. Sgo1 then disappears at meiosis II to allow sister chromatids to separate.	Cellular Processes; Cell growth and death	Meiosis - yeast
